## SWAPI API
Using React.js and https://swapi.co/
Create a grid of 4 columns that contains a thumbnail with film titles.
The grid can be reorganized to be ordered by released date or by episode number.
When you hover the thumbnail it should slightly animate up and add a shadow behind the image.
When you click on the thumbnail it should open a detail view that shows : Title, director, producer, episode id, opening crawl, species and characters.
Each character should link to the character url.

## Run project

npm run start
```
